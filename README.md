Iteration 3
In this iteration we are going to practise how to deploy your website on a hosting provider.

Netlify is a cloud-based hosting provider that allows clients to deploy small website for free, so it is perfect for small prototypes or non-commercial projects.

This is a good chance to refresh your HTML and CSS knowledge! Create a small webpage in HTML and CSS with a heading, a footer and a centered image in the middle, then style the page.

Once you are done, create a GitHub repository and sync your website.
